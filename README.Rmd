# hkpopr

The goal of hkpopr is to provide Hong Kong Public Opinion Data from the Public Opinion Programme (POP).

## Installation

You can install the released version of hkpopr from [Github](https://github.com/iriszy/hkpopr) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("iriszy/hkpopr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to get a survey table from POP's website:

```{r example}
hkpop(url = "https://www.hkupop.hku.hk/english/popexpress/sargperf/sarg/halfyr/datatables.html")
```

You can also use the two datasets `pop_list` and `pop_score` in the package, which have combined 39 survey tables from POP's websites.
